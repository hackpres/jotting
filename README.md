## Description
Jotting is a note taking app designed with simple express commands within node. It has the functionality to write, save, and delete notes.

    The real motivation behind Jotting was to become more familiar working with express, while building a functional backend for a useful practical application.

    Get, Post, and Delete routes were the biggest lesson learned while developing this app. I really enjoyed using req.params.id to access the id for the note to delete. Along that same line was utilizing the npm uuid package to generate random unique id's for each note posted.
